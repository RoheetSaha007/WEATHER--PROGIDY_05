This Weather App is a web-based application that allows users to see current weather conditions by fetching data from a weather API. Users can either allow the app to access their device location or enter a location manually to view weather information for that area. The app then displays relevant weather data, such as temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the current weather.

Key Features
Location-Based Weather Data:

Geolocation Access: When users allow location access, the app automatically fetches the weather data for their current location.
Manual Location Input: Alternatively, users can enter a city name to fetch and display the weather data for a specific location.
Real-Time Weather Data Fetching:

The app fetches data from a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.), providing live weather updates. API calls are made based on the user’s input or detected location.
Weather Details Display:

Temperature: Shows the current temperature, often in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
Weather Description: Describes the weather conditions (e.g., clear sky, rain, cloudy).
Humidity: Shows the current humidity level as a percentage.
Wind Speed: Displays the speed of the wind in meters per second or kilometers per hour.
Weather Icon: An icon representing the weather condition (e.g., a sun icon for clear skies or a cloud icon for overcast conditions).
Additional Info (Optional): May include details like "feels like" temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunrise/sunset times.
Technical Details
HTML:

Structure the page with an input field for manual location input and a button to fetch the weather.
Display areas (divs) for weather information like temperature, weather description, and an icon.
CSS:

Style the app to make it visually appealing, with fonts, colors, and layout that enhance readability.
Use animations (optional) to make data changes visually engaging.
JavaScript:

Fetch API: Use JavaScript’s Fetch API to request weather data from the chosen API. This could be based on:
User’s current coordinates using the Geolocation API.
The user-inputted city name for manual search.
Data Parsing: Extract relevant data from the API response, including temperature, description, icon code, and other details.
Display Update: Update the HTML elements with the fetched data, showing the weather information in real-time.
Weather API Integration:

Use an API like OpenWeatherMap (requires a free API key) to get real-time weather data.
Construct an API request URL based on either coordinates (latitude/longitude) or city name.
Sample Workflow
User Action: The user can either allow location access or input a city name.
API Request: JavaScript makes a request to the weather API using either the geolocation coordinates or the city name.
Response Handling: The app receives a response from the API, which includes data like temperature, weather description, and an icon code.
UI Update: The app displays the weather information on the page, updating fields with the latest data.
